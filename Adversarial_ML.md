title: 'Adversarial ML'
---


Machine learning has shown significant success in solving complex problems, but current machine learning algorithms produce models that are vulnerable to adversaries who may want to mislead them. 
So far,  machine learning algorithms have been designed to run in benign environments. 
Increasing use of machine learning algorithms in security applications, motivated adversaries to focus on the vulnerability of machine learning. 
In the adversarial environment, the adversary can interfere in the training and the prediction phases of machine learning algorithms. Adversarial example is one of the most important vulnerabilities in machine learning algorithms, which is intentionally designed by to evade the machine learning model.
