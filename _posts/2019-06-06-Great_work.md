“Anything worth doing, is worth doing right.”<br>
[Hunter S Thompson](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/76425-anything-worth-doing-is-worth-doing-right)

I'm not scared of a computer passing the turing test... I'm terrified of one that intentionally fails it.<br>

Oh my friend we're older but no wiser <br />
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same <br />
[Gene Raskin]

There's a lot of beauty in ordinary things, isn't that kind of the point? <br />
[The Office]

Among those whom I like or admire, I can find no common denominator, but among those whom I love, I can: all of them make me laugh.<br />
[W. H. Auden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._H._Auden)

I think we spend too much time being afraid of our own mediocrity<br>
We don't want to sing too loudly in case someone finds out that we don't have a voice like glass<br>
We don't write music because we aren't Mozart<br>
We don't paint because we're not Picasso<br>
We don't tell people that we love them because our voice might shake when we say it.<br>
We try to be pretty criers<br>
We don't dance because we aren't that good<br>
The reality of our humanity is that we are all a little bit average at a lot of things.<br>
The truth is that we're all not that good.<br>
So stop holding yourself back from enjoying the things that you love because you're not a prodigy at everything.<br>
Scream the song at the top of your lungs and confess you love<br>
And let your voice be shaky<br>
Cry big ugly tears<br>
Dance really badly<br>
Because life is too short to be scared of being human.<br>
[Whitney Hanson]<br>


excuse me I’m sorry, I don’t mean to impose,<br>
but if you have just a minute could you listen to this poem, <br>
don’t worry it won’t offend anyone, and if it does i am already sorry, <br>
and here while you listen, you can stand on my feet just to make sure I don’t step on your toes, <br>
and if there’s anything you don’t like please let me know. <br>
you see I have many masks and I can easily mould, <br>
if you think I’m too loud i can be quiet,<br>
if you think I’m too warm i can be cold, <br>
if you think I’m too careful i can be reckless, <br>
if you think I’m too mean i can be nice. <br>
I can be it I can be what you like. <br>
I can be what you like. <br>
I don’t know what im like. <br>
I don’t know what I like. <br>
I don’t know who i am. <br>
I’m not sure if I know the difference anymore between me and my masks.<br>
I can’t take them off now, I’ve been wearing them for so long,<br>
and im afraid if i do the person underneath will be gone,<br>
who was l before I cared what you think,<br>
which mask looks the most like who l want to be<br>
[Whitney Hanson]
