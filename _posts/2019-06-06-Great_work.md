“Anything worth doing, is worth doing right.”<br>
[Hunter S Thompson](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/76425-anything-worth-doing-is-worth-doing-right)

I'm not scared of a computer passing the turing test... I'm terrified of one that intentionally fails it.<br>

Oh my friend we're older but no wiser <br />
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same <br />
[Gene Raskin]

There's a lot of beauty in ordinary things, isn't that kind of the point? <br />
[The Office]

Among those whom I like or admire, I can find no common denominator, but among those whom I love, I can: all of them make me laugh.<br />
[W. H. Auden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._H._Auden)

I think we spend too much time being afraid of our own mediocrity<br>
We don't want to sing too loudly in case someone finds out that we don't have a voice like glass<br>
We don't write music because we aren't Mozart<br>
We don't paint because we're not Picasso<br>
We don't tell people that we love them because our voice might shake when we say it.<br>
We try to be pretty criers<br>
We don't dance because we aren't that good<br>
The reality of our humanity is that we are all a little bit average at a lot of things.<br>
The truth is that we're all not that good.<br>
So stop holding yourself back from enjoying the things that you love because you're not a prodigy at everything.<br>
Scream the song at the top of your lungs and confess you love<br>
And let your voice be shaky<br>
Cry big ugly tears<br>
Dance really badly<br>
Because life is too short to be scared of being human.<br>
[Whitney Hanson]<br>
