“Anything worth doing, is worth doing right.”<br>
[Hunter S Thompson](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/76425-anything-worth-doing-is-worth-doing-right)

I'm not scared of a computer passing the turing test... I'm terrified of one that intentionally fails it.<br>

Oh my friend we're older but no wiser <br />
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same <br />
[Gene Raskin]

There's a lot of beauty in ordinary things, isn't that kind of the point? <br />
[The Office]

Among those whom I like or admire, I can find no common denominator, but among those whom I love, I can: all of them make me laugh.<br />
[W. H. Auden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._H._Auden)

I think we spend too much time being afraid of our own mediocrity
We don't want to sing too loudly in case someone finds out that we don't have a voice like glass
We don't write music because we aren't Mozart
We don't paint because we're not Picasso
We don't tell people that we love them because our voice might shake when we say it.
We try to be pretty criers
We don't dance because we aren't that good
The reality of our humanity is that we are all a little bit average at a lot of things.
The truth is that we're all not that good.
So stop holding yourself back from enjoying the things that you love because you're not a prodigy at everything.
Scream the song at the top of your lungs and confess you love
And let your voice be shaky
Cry big ugly tears
Dance really badly
Because life is too short to be scared of being human.
[Whitney Hanson]


excuse me I’m sorry, I don’t mean to impose,
but if you have just a minute could you listen to this poem, 
don’t worry it won’t offend anyone, and if it does i am already sorry, 
and here while you listen, you can stand on my feet just to make sure I don’t step on your toes, 
and if there’s anything you don’t like please let me know. 
you see I have many masks and I can easily mould, 
if you think I’m too loud i can be quiet, 
if you think I’m too loud i can be cold, 
if you think I’m too careful i can be reckless, 
if you think I’m too mean i can be nice. 
I can be it I can be what you like. 
I can be what you like. 
I don’t know what im like. 
I don’t know what I like. 
I don’t know who i am. 
I’m not sure if I know the difference anymore between me and my masks.
I can’t take them off now, I’ve been wearing them for so long,
and im afraid if i do the person underneath will be gone,
who was l before I cared what you think,
which mask looks the most like who l want to be
[Whitney Hanson]
